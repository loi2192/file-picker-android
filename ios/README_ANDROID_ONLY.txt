⚠️ ANDROID ONLY PLUGIN ⚠️

This plugin has been modified to ONLY support Android.
iOS support has been completely removed.

If you are seeing this during an iOS build, it means you are trying to use 
an Android-only plugin in an iOS project.

Solutions:
1. Remove this plugin from your iOS project
2. Use the original @capawesome/capacitor-file-picker plugin
3. Use a different file picker plugin that supports iOS
